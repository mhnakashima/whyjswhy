Hello Webdeveloper or someone wannabe be being one.

Sometimes when we are creating web applications, sites or doing stuff for studying and get better on web development
So, I started to use JS as your main web stack, since Javascript was created a so many years ago, there were a plenty
of strange things when we are using JS.

This project WJSW will try to cover strange things that may happen.

Enjoy.

## Syntax Parser:

Basically something needs to understand what you trying to read what's going on to convert on instructions 
and allocate these instructions on memory.

Convert Code to Computer Instructions.

## Execution Context

## Name Value Pairs

## Global Env - Javascript Engine 
    - Global Object
    - This
        - Everytime that you start to run any 
        javascript application, the browser engine
        creates to objects, Global and This
        - Global Object
        - variable this, in global level, they are equal

    - Global = Not inside the function, everything that is not nested inside any function

    - My code where my code is provided nested on Execution Context

## Hoisting

    - Creation Phase - Execution Context
        - Global / this / Outer Env
    - Execution Phase - Hoisting
        - Memory allocation
        - setting default value for a
        - allocate function to some place in memory
